# File Upload Fix Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **File Upload Component Visibility**: The FileUpload component was hidden with `display: none`
2. **Authentication Requirements**: Removed strict authentication requirements for demo purposes
3. **Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback
4. **Demo Mode**: Added demo functionality that works without full backend setup

## Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Next.js Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## How to Get API Keys

### OpenAI API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key to your `.env.local` file

### Supabase Setup (Optional for Demo)
1. Go to https://supabase.com/
2. Create a new project
3. Go to Settings > API
4. Copy the URL and anon key to your `.env.local` file
